Create beautiful online forms, surveys, quizzes, and much more.

== Description ==
“Oh, goodie. An online form,” said no one, ever.

But what if you could change that?

With Typeform, you can make forms and surveys people actually like filling in. The one-question-at-a-time interface feels more like a conversation—and gets better responses as a result. Get more leads, grow your contact list, collect feedback, and much more.

Customize your typeform’s font, color scheme, background, and images to match your brand—and embed it seamlessly into your web page. Typeforms look and feel great on any device.

------------

> **Important**
> This plugin is for embedding forms created over at Typeform. You can’t edit them or see responses inside WordPress.
> This plugin is incompatible with Wordpress 4 and the new Gutenberg editor. If you need support for Wordpress 4, please use [version 0.7.5](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/typeform.0.7.5.zip).
